## Momit scope
The main goal of Momit is to bring your files into R, and typically into a `<mom>`.


If:

  * your database is clean
  * if you are in your working directory
  
It should only take:

> from_*()

For example: `from_mask` or `from_tps`.

If your database is a mess, then the battle may be long but Momit can give a hand. This is described in [tidy_database.html](Tidying database) vignette.












```{r setup}
library(Momit)
```






In the end, you have a `coo_tbl`
