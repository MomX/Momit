```{r setup}
library(Momit)
```

Momit use intricated functions to do things right.If your data are already manically organized, you will only need the top level one: `import`. But shall you need finer grain control, here is the depth tree:

* __import__ wraps around these two
  * __sniff__ will find your files and return a tibble
  * __from_\*__ will find column (`path` by default) in the previous and import them. It maps paths to the correct parser
    * __parse_\*__ is the workhouse where conversion actually happens
    






In the end, you have a `coo_tbl`
